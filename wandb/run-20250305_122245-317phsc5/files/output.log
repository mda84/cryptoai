`st.cache` is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use one of Streamlit's new
caching commands, `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource`. More information
[in our docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching).
**Note**: The behavior of `st.cache` was updated in Streamlit 1.36 to the new caching
logic used by `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`. This might lead to some problems
or unexpected behavior in certain edge cases.

`st.cache` is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use one of Streamlit's new
caching commands, `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource`. More information
[in our docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching).
**Note**: The behavior of `st.cache` was updated in Streamlit 1.36 to the new caching
logic used by `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`. This might lead to some problems
or unexpected behavior in certain edge cases.

`st.cache` is deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use one of Streamlit's new
caching commands, `st.cache_data` or `st.cache_resource`. More information
[in our docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching).
**Note**: The behavior of `st.cache` was updated in Streamlit 1.36 to the new caching
logic used by `st.cache_data` and `st.cache_resource`. This might lead to some problems
or unexpected behavior in certain edge cases.
